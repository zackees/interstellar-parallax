The parrallax demo was lifted from the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3j_Dx4u7c
The original demo weighed in at around ~40mb with a surprising number of layers. Using `run.py` I've compressed the PNGs to webp format, which are smaller because of lossy compression algorithms (PNG is lossless, surprisingly) and also the width/height has been reduced to 50%.
`run.py` will run on the `src` directory and replace everything in the `out` directory.
